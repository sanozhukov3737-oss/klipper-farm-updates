"""Apply the reviewed R201 announcement retry over the exact sequence-163 candidate.

On a farm with several printers, trySpeakNeuralAnnouncement returns false whenever speech is
already busy, and the completion call ignored that value. Two prints finishing within one sentence
meant the second announcement was lost with no sound, no error and no journal entry.

An earlier version of this overlay queued announcements inside the speech module. That changed the
module's contract, broke the existing voice regressions and required rewriting them — more risk
than the bug warranted. This version keeps the module untouched and fixes the loss where it
happens: the completion announcement retries at 1, 3, 7 and 15 seconds until it is played. By then
the reply has finished, so the message is heard instead of dropped.

Near-end notices already retried on their own five second tick, so only the completion path needed
this.
