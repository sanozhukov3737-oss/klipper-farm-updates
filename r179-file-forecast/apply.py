"""Apply the reviewed R179 file-forecast source over the exact sequence-159 candidate.

R177 added the forecast to the report table, so the operator learns what a file usually
takes only after the print is over. The decision it should inform happens earlier, in the
file library, next to the slicer estimate.

The forecast now also reads the local print records, which is where the library gets its
data from. Those records keep the duration in a field named duration, while the Moonraker
history rows use print_duration and total_duration, so the reader takes the first positive
value instead of the first present one: a zero in print_duration must not hide a real
duration next to it.

File comparison moved into one exported key. The library holds printer paths and the report
holds history filenames; two separate rules for stripping a path and lowercasing would drift
apart silently, and then the same part would stop matching itself.

Nothing here reaches the network: the library reads the records the report already stores,
so opening the panel still issues no printer requests.
